•	Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
The event tracker is a calendar app that allows users create events, add in appointments and set reminders to help users stay on track.  The goal for this application is to help users stay organized and have a calendar of all events easily accessible.  

•	What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
There are 3 screens within the app.  The set up or login app (depending on new or returning users), the dates screen and the view dates screen.  The UI design kept users in mind by it being very user friendly.  The design is made to be so users can move within the app and from screen to screen without any real issue. 

•	How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
I approached the process of coding by making sure what I knew the user wanted and needed.  I wanted to make sure this was a user friendly application that required little to no training on how to use it.  I created a list of all the things I wanted to develop and then stuck to that list to help prevent error.  Those were the main strategies I used.  I would continue to use this in any future projects I have as it seems to keep me on track and in time frame. 

•	How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
I think this process is important because it will help you find errors that you may not have seen if you just keep going without an outline of what you should be doing.  

•	Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
I had quite a bit of challenges with this.  I think I was trying to do to much in the beginning so I had to go back and simplify it more.  At the end of the day a calendar is a calendar.  Sometimes simple can be better. I think with just the 3 screens it is a cleaner look and more user friendly.

•	In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
I think the UI was the easiest part to do.  It seemed like that was the part that I was able to get easily and I didn’t really have any challenges with it.
